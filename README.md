### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leanne Sall and I am currently studying software development at British Columbia Institute of Technology!
I love coding and working with others on projects. I use the MERN stack currently but I love learning and never mind branching out to new technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity web and mobile app, combining a lot of different concepts
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Unity, Node, Dart and Flutter
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really :) I love to work with people
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to get in contact with me feel free to email me at leannesall@gmail.com or check out my linkdin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-sall/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a productivity nerd and have about a bazillion hobbies. I also have a very cute dog named Winnie and a cat named Skully! You can see more about me on my portfolio website [here](https://leannesall.dev).
